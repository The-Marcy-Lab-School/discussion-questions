# Discussion Question - Advanced Git Topics

## Directions
- In an in-person class, have a group member hook up their laptop to a larger monitor. In a remote class, have a group member share their screen.
- Tackle each discussion questions below one at a time as a group.
- First, try to discuss and answer the questions using just your collective knowledge. Then reference your notes as needed.
- Lastly, you can Google or look up the answers if desired.

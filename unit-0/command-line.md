# Group Discussion Question - Command Line

## Directions
In an in-person class, have a group member hook up their laptop to a larger monitor. In a remote class, have each group member take turns sharing their screen.

1. Use [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/bash) to do the following four practice problems. When you open Repl.it, notice the command line on the right and the directories and files on the left.
2. As a group, do one practice at a time. For each, only one person types and screen shares, while the other group members should coach them through the problem.
3. Rate yourself on a scale of 1-5 on how comfortable you feel using the command line (1 for not comfortable and 5 for very comfortable). The person who scored lowest should start first and share their screen.
4. Rotate accordingly at the end of each practice to the person who scored themselves next lowest.

Practice 1 - recreate the following directory and file structure using the Command Line:
```

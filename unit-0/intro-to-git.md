# Discussion Question - Git

## Directions
- In an in-person class, have a group member hook up their laptop to a larger monitor. In a remote class, have a group member share their screen.
- Tackle each discussion question one at a time, making sure **_everyone answers every question_**. 
- Take 20 minutes to _discuss_ and _debate_ these questions as a group. We will review them as a class afterwards. 


## Discussion Questions

* What is Git? What are the benefits of using Git? 

* How would you explain to a non-technical person what Git is?

* What is the purpose of GitHub?

* Explain the differences between Git and Github?

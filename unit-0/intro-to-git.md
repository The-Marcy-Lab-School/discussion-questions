## Directions
- In an in-person class, have a group member hook up their laptop to a larger monitor. In a remote class, have a group member share their screen.
- As a group, tackle each discussion question below one at a time.
- First, try to discuss and answer the questions using just your collective knowledge. Then reference your notes as needed.

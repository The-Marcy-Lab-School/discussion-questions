# Discussion Question - Intro to Git

## Directions
- Tackle each discussion questions below one at a time.
- For each question, every member of the group should verbally share their answer/explanation. Try not to Google or look up the answers yet.
- Then, verbally discuss the question as a whole group. Optionally, you can Google or look up the answer to confirm or adjust your understanding.
- Take 30 minutes total to do this activity. It's ok if you were not able to get to every question.

# Discussion Question - JS Documentation

## Directions
- In an in-person class, have a group member hook up their laptop to a larger monitor. In a remote class, have a group member share their screen.
- Tackle each discussion question one at a time, making sure **_everyone share their answer to every question_**. 
- Take 20 minutes to _discuss_ and _debate_ these questions as a group. We will review them as a class afterwards.

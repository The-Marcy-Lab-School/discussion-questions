# Discussion Question - JS Prework Review

## Directions
- In an in-person class, have a group member hook up their laptop to a larger monitor. In a remote class, have a group member share their screen.
- Tackle each discussion question one at a time, making sure **_everyone share their answer to every question_**. 
- Take 20 minutes to _discuss_ and _debate_ these questions as a group. We will review them as a class afterwards. 


## Discussion Questions

* When should you use a for loop instead of a while loop? When should you use a do while loop instead of a while loop?

* Your company wants to use a data structure to keep track of alot of data. Under what circumstances would you recommend using an Array vs. an Object?

* Your non-technical teammate has asked you to explain how to use `.slice()`. Read the MDN Documention on [.slice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice). How would you explain it to your teammate?

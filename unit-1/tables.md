# Discussion Question - HTML Tables

## Directions
- In an in-person class, have a group member hook up their laptop to a larger monitor. In a remote class, have a group member share their screen.
- For each queestion, **_everyone should share their explantion, an example, or a mental model_**. 
- Take 20 minutes to _discuss_ and _debate_ these questions as a group. We will review them as a class afterwards. 

## Questions
* What is the structure of an HTML table? Be sure to include *at least* the tags `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, and `<th>` in your explanation.
* How do you allow cells to span multiple columns? Multiple rows?
* How do we apply common styling to elements in the same column of our table?

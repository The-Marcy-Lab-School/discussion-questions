# Discussion Question - JavaScript

## Directions
- In an in-person class, have a group member hook up their laptop to a larger monitor. In a remote class, have a group member share their screen.
- For each queestion, **_everyone should share their explantion, an example, or a mental model_**. 
- Take 20 minutes to _discuss_ and _debate_ these questions as a group. We will review them as a class afterwards. 

## Questions
* What are arrays and why are they useful _data structures_?
* How do we _iterate_ over arrays to access individual _elements_?
* What does it mean for arrays to be _passed by reference_ in JavaScript?

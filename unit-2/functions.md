# Discussion Question - JavaScript

## Directions
- In an in-person class, have a group member hook up their laptop to a larger monitor. In a remote class, have a group member share their screen.
- For each queestion, **_everyone should share their explantion, an example, or a mental model_**. 
- Take 20 minutes to _discuss_ and _debate_ these questions as a group. We will review them as a class afterwards. 

## Questions
* How do we declare functions in JavaScript?
* How does a function declared using function declaration notation differ from a function declared as function expression?
* What does hoisting mean and how does it impact the way that we write our JavaScript programs?
* How does JavaScript handle extra arguments during function invocation? What about missing arguments?

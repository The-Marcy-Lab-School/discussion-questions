# Discussion Question - Objects

## Directions
- In an in-person class, have a group member hook up their laptop to a larger monitor. In a remote class, have a group member share their screen.
- For each queestion, **_everyone should share their explantion, an example, or a mental model_**. 
- Take 20 minutes to _discuss_ and _debate_ these questions as a group. We will review them as a class afterwards. 

## Questions

What is an object and why are they useful?
How do we access properties and methods? When can we use dot notation and when must we use bracket notation?
What data types can be valid object _keys_ in JavaScript? What about _values_?

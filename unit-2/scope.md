# Discussion Question - Scope

## Directions
- In an in-person class, have a group member hook up their laptop to a larger monitor. In a remote class, have a group member share their screen.
- For each queestion, **_everyone should share their explantion, an example, or a mental model_**. 
- Take 20 minutes to _discuss_ and _debate_ these questions as a group. We will review them as a class afterwards. 

## Questions

* How do variables declared with var, let, and const differ *in terms of scope*?
* Why wouldn't we simply declare all of our variables in the global scope?
* How are function parameters scoped?
* How does JavaScript reconcile variables declared with the same name in different scopes?

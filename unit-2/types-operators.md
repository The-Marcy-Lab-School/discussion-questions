# Discussion Question - Types and Operators

## Directions
- In an in-person class, have a group member hook up their laptop to a larger monitor. In a remote class, have a group member share their screen.
- For each queestion, **_everyone should share their explantion, an example, or a mental model_**. 
- Take 20 minutes to _discuss_ and _debate_ these questions as a group. We will review them as a class afterwards. 

## Questions

* What are logical operators and what is their purpose?
* What are the rules that JavaScript adheres to when coercing a value to a different type?
* How can we avoid implicit type coercion and why might we want to do this?
